<p>What is CSS? According to Wikipedia.com, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media.</p>
 
<p1> CSS was first developed in 1997 as a way for web developers to define the visual appearance of the web pages that they were creating. It was intended to allow web professionals to separate the content and structure of a website's code from the visual design, something that had not been possible prior to this time.</p1>
